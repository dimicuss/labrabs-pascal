Welcome to the updated version of the website for South
Dakota School for the Deaf
(SDSD)!
SDSD is proud to pair the launch of the
new logo with a completely redesigned website.
Within the tabs above, you will find several new
avenues to information such as programs,
activities, and resources for parents and
service providers of children who are deaf and hard of hearing.
SDSD is working diligently to grow the content of
our website. Check out our new tabs under Resources: Videos and ASL,
Apps, & More. We've also added a link to the SDSD YouTube channel under
Social Media in the banner at the base of our website.
